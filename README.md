## Description
**Pescader√≠a Carenero**  is an e-commerce website designed for a local seafood company specializing in artisanal marine products. The platform allows customers to browse, select, and purchase products seamlessly. It features a shopping cart managed with  **Redux**, a user-friendly checkout flow, and integration with the  **WhatsApp API**  for order confirmation.

_üí° This project represents one of my early experiences with  **Redux**  and complex user flows. While it‚Äôs not perfect, it was a crucial step in my journey as a developer, teaching me valuable lessons about state management, UI/UX design, and integrating third-party services._

## Main Features


### Global State Management

The website uses  **Redux**  to manage the global state, particularly for the shopping cart. This ensures a seamless and consistent user experience across the application.

### Shopping Cart

Users can add, edit, and remove products from their cart and product cards. The state is preserved throughout the user's session, allowing for a smooth shopping experience.

### Checkout Flow

The checkout process includes:

-   A review page where users can confirm their order and make last-minute changes.
    
-   A form to enter personal and delivery information.
    
-   Integration with the  **WhatsApp API**  to automatically generate a message with the order details, which is sent directly to the company for processing.
    

### Product Search and Filtering

Users can easily search for products and apply filters to find exactly what they're looking for.
